# a) Hijacked Line - what motivates cyber criminals go after the crown jewels?
I chose to analyse a Darknet Diaries episode "Hijacked Line" (episode 154, https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/154/). This is a story about a teenager (13 year old) named Connor who got carried away by the feeling of being in power in digital world, that could make him possibly even rich one day. From hacking games to accounts, and from accounts to identities, he was able to go after the crown jewels at that time: cryptocurrency. As the heists went on, conscience and fear of getting caught started to kick in, but it was too late. His fellow cyber criminal friend was caught, and path lead to him getting him sentenced in jail. After his release - and luckily for his conscience - he was able to turn his past experience to do good and help others to fight against cyber criminals.

My main points about the episode wrapped in my analysis:
- You can get hooked in having power over things, which can be power of changing environment (e.g. cheating or hacking new skills or possesions in games), or power over people (stealing accounts). It gives you sense of being able to control what was uncontrollable before because lack of abilities in general.
- Eventually you can get more greedy, as well as in money but also in power after gaining skills in hacking: from hacking individual accounts you proceed something else as SIM swapping, allowing you to switch your identity and becoming in the center of the attack looking at different direction to proceed. E.g. SIM swapping allows you to reset email password, and that allows you to reset other accounts easily, and thus gain access to more accounts, even cryptocurrency.
- Conscience with the real risk of being caught can act as a motivation to stop - and to change the course of direction in your life.


# b) Bank cards under attack
I was reading a blog about a Wall Street Journal article posted in Schneider's blog:
https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/social-engineering-peoples-credit-card-details.html

Here are my main points about the blog:
- Cyber criminal organizations are finding ways to persuade people to enter their bank card information for criminal purposes
- The criminal organizations operating from China have gained over 1 billion dollars over the past three years
- The crimilans install stolen bank card information to cloud providers' bank services such as Apple and Google Wallets, and make purchase of luxury and other purchases from otherside of the world, China.

## What to do?

By listening to the Hijacked Line episode it makde me think the motivation of these cyber criminals. Are these just little kids playing around or organized criminals? I guess the concience for many people would kick in, if there would be a real risk of being caught. Should internet be developed towards "identified users"? But what if this act of stealing credit cards is somewhat supported by the government (by not caring, or by not having resources to solve them, or just simply because the actors are part of the government)? That would of course create a sense of protection, so what would act as a conscious to stop act that would generally be consider as criminal. Political needle can change in this dramatically.

# c) Strong type of passworldess authentication is needed
In the h1 assignment I chose to read about passwordless authentication. It got me thinking of ways that how to prevent bank cards, accounts or even identities being stolen. Could artificial intelligence (or more specific machine learning) be able to give us some possibilities in this? Could we built a system, that could analyse your actions (if you allow it to) to verify that you are actually you. We need to continue our way to make it harder for criminals to steal money from regular people. Of course you could say that you don't need to be faster than the bear catching you, just make sure to be faster than your friend when running away.. But should we try to build a system without any bears, or if there will be, then at least they would wear an beacon so we can find it, and make the bear accountable for its actions :-)
