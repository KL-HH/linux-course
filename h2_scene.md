# Bank cards under attack
I was reading a blog about a Wall Street Journal article posted in Schneider's blog:
https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/social-engineering-peoples-credit-card-details.html

Here are my main points about the blog:
- Cyber criminal organizations are finding ways to persuade people to enter their bank card information for criminal purposes
- The criminal organizations operating from China have gained over 1 billion dollars over the past three years
- The crimilans install stolen bank card information to cloud providers' bank services such as Apple and Google Wallets, and make purchase of luxury and other purchases from otherside of the world, China.

## What to do?

I wonder, why the banking institutions have been built such a way, that the money couldn't be forcefully transferred back to the owner? I mean, what if there would be a system, that the money "earned" criminal way can be taken back? Yes I know, there are a lot of issues in this, but as a play of thought, what if the banking world would work like that?

Of course there are issues in this... That if you cash out the money gained criminal way from the bank you can't get it back to the owner, unless we "create" money out of nothing by allowing the accounts of cyber criminals to go negative. But at least when the account is negative, the criminals would owe the bank after that. I would think, that banks would be very careful not to let suspicious activity to happen so easily and would want to solve origins of the money more carefully. Otherwise they face the risk to run out of business very fast. I know there are a lot of issues in this, but I'm visualizing my ideal kind of world where the criminals wouldn't find an easy way to "earn" money. What's your way?
