The following will represent my thoughts of a cyber security course of my dreams.

# Defence Cyber Security course

 In this course, you will
- get an overview of cyber security and the defence mechanism related to that
- learn how to protect your company information
- learn how to analyse (possible) threats with some hand on exercises.

Each lesson lasts 3 hours (with 2 x 15 min breaks)

### 3rd lecture: Threat modeling
Introducing the topic of threat modeling. 
- Topic:
    - How can company's prepare themselves against the cyber threats?
    - What methods are there to achieve systematic threat modeling? 
- We will discuss some systematic ways to model the threats of the company.
- In this lecture we will also start hands on group work using the Cybermeter tool by Traficom (https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/our-services/situation-awareness-and-network-management/kybermittari-cybermeter)
  - Group work: groups are divided into groups of three persons. Group will choose one to be the facilitator, one to be the technical expert, and one to be the business representative. Each person is given a short description of a hypothetical scenario of person's hypothetical role in the company. This will work as a basis for the answers. The group will choose "ACCESS" or "THIRD-PARTIES" topic of the Cyber meter tool (by Traficom):
  - E.g. the description of:
      - technical expert is: "You are the leading technical expert of a critical system of your company (choose the system). After several acquisitions the company is struggling with aligning the system's information flow, assets, access management, and third-party collaboration. The users are not familiar with the new standards and workflows, and you see this in practice as data quality is getting worse and ticket level is rising fast. Some technical dependencies have issues, and some hardware components are getting old. Company's internal instructions are sometimes contradicting and you are manouvering in a difficult situation. Business is pushing development ideas to keep up with the business needs. At the moment, you need to prioritize a lot, but the company has only limited amount to resources to help (money and workforce)"
      - business representative is: "With new acquisitions the business has expanded giving some new opportunities. You can not be happier with the work nowadays. You feel that everything is better. From your perspective you would require more agile ways of working. No more instructions, as it's already too tough to navigate in the bureaucracy, slowing down the business giving room to competitors. The current tools are good enough, and you see no problem in that as work is getting done now in agile way, which you value. Money situation is scarse. Next two years no new development work or purchases are done, if possible. Working with stakeholders goes very well, and from your side the quality has improved."
      - facilitator's description is: "be critical, ask questions. Your role is to try to find the truth, and try to report the underlying issues from all sides. The situation might not be as bad as someone says, or not so good either."
- Assignment: Choose at least three topics of the cyber security meter. Think the topics from your own company's perspective or hypothetical situation. Write also comments so teacher can follow the chain of thoughts. Chosen values are doesn't need to be true, as long as they are relevant for you.
