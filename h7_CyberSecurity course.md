The following will represent my thoughts of a cyber security course of my dreams.

# Defence Cyber Security course

 In this course, you will
- get an overview of cyber security and the defence mechanism related to that
- learn how to protect your company information
- learn how to analyse (possible) threats with some hand on exercises.

Each lesson lasts approximately 3 hours (with 2 x 15 min breaks)

## Agenda

### 1st lecture: cyber security today

From 1980's to cyber security today. 
- Includes topics, such as:
     - What has happened?
     - Why cyber security plays a crucial role in protecting the company's information?
- Group work: students will be divided to five groups and presented predefined topics wich will be analysed from cyber security perspective. Topics are: electrical cars, master data management, online bank authentication (strong identification), airplane security, Public WiFi, IoT, GPS. Make a SWOT analysis (Strenghts, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) of the technologies (30 min time)
- Presenting the group work.
- Home work: Short case study of a cyber security incidents (max. 1 page). Present the case in the next class (5 min presentation). Include such topics as
   - what happened, how the attack was made?
   - what led into the situation?
   - what was the result for the company?
   - what can we learn from the incident (your own thoughts)?

(RATIONALE: Understanding how did we get to this situation might give us better perspective of future trend)
 

### 2nd lecture: Importance of cyber security 
Student presentations. Rest of the lecture we will discuss about the importance of cyber security nowadays. 
- Topics:
   - What kind of vulnerabilities are out there?
   - Where are the attacks pointed at? What motivates the attacks?
- Home work: Write a short analysis (about 5 pages) on the potential security threats in your job role or job role you are particularly interested of. Deadline in three weeks. Make a presentation

(RATIONALE: Giving insights of differenct cases, to be more aware of cyber threats and the consequences)

### 3rd lecture: Threat modeling
Introducing the topic of threat modeling. 
- Topic:
    - How can company's prepare themselves against the cyber threats?
    - What methods are there to achieve systematic threat modeling? 
- We will discuss some systematic ways to model the threats of the company.
- In this lecture we will also start hands on group work using the Cybermeter tool by Traficom (https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/our-services/situation-awareness-and-network-management/kybermittari-cybermeter)
  - Group work: groups are divided into groups of three persons. Group will choose one to be the facilitator, one to be the technical expert, and one to be the business representative. Each person is given a short description of a hypothetical scenario of person's hypothetical role in the company. This will work as a basis for the answers. The group will choose "ACCESS" or "THIRD-PARTIES" topic of the Cyber meter tool (by Traficom):
  - E.g. the description of:
      - technical expert is: "You are the leading technical expert of a critical system of your company (choose the system). After several acquisitions the company is struggling with aligning the system's information flow, assets, access management, and third-party collaboration. The users are not familiar with the new standards and workflows, and you see this in practice as data quality is getting worse and ticket level is rising fast. Some technical dependencies have issues, and some hardware components are getting old. Company's internal instructions are sometimes contradicting and you are manouvering in a difficult situation. Business is pushing development ideas to keep up with the business needs. At the moment, you need to prioritize a lot, but the company has only limited amount to resources to help (money and workforce)"
      - business representative is: "With new acquisitions the business has expanded giving some new opportunities. You can not be happier with the work nowadays. You feel that everything is better. From your perspective you would require more agile ways of working. No more instructions, as it's already too tough to navigate in the bureaucracy, slowing down the business giving room to competitors. The current tools are good enough, and you see no problem in that as work is getting done now in agile way, which you value. Money situation is scarse. Next two years no new development work or purchases are done, if possible. Working with stakeholders goes very well, and from your side the quality has improved."
      - facilitator's description is: "be critical, ask questions. Your role is to try to find the truth, and try to report the underlying issues from all sides. The situation might not be as bad as someone says, or not so good either."
- Home work: Choose at least three topics of the cyber security meter. Think the topics from your own company's perspective or hypothetical situation. Write also comments so teacher can follow the chain of thoughts. Chosen values are doesn't need to be true, as long as they are relevant for you. 

(RATIONALE: Understand how to analyse threats in your company with the help of some publicly available tools)

### 4th lecture: Visiting lecturer and threat analysis
This lecture includes a visiting lecturer of the F-Secure or Withsecure company.
- Topic: 
    - A day in the cyber security professionals life
    - how do we detect the new malware?
    - how cyber security professionals work to protect our data against the newest or yet to be discovered threats? 
    - how do we analyse constant threats from the web?
Home work: Write one page essay about the topic of the lesson. Read about threat analysis and prevention. Take a quiz in the Moodle (minimum 50% correct answers needed to pass)

(RATIONALE: Visiting lecturers are unique opportunities for students to learn and get closer to work life with the topic)

### 5th lecture: Threat analysis in action
Cyber security in practice
- Topic:
  - Threat analysis
    - Scanning from the perspective of malicious attack
    - Scanning from the perspective of the defender
- Home work: There is a hypothetical attack. Follow the instructions of this hypothetical situation. Report your actions and chain of thought you have taken to prevent, mitigate and to improve the situation.

(RATIONALE: hands-on training to build up practical skills)

### 6th lecture: Threat detection and prevention
Cyber security in practice
- Topic: cyber breach ongoing
   - Analyse the situation
   - Take defensive measures
   - Prevent, mitigate and take corrective actions to reduce the damage.
- Home work: You have been breached. Follow the instructions of this hypothetical situation. Report your actions and chain of thought you have taken to prevent, mitigate and to improve the situation.

(RATIONALE: hands-on training to build up practical skills)

### 7th lecture: Designing the anti-malware systems
Designing anti-virus and other threat detecting softwares
- Topic:
   - How does the anti-virus system work in practice?
   - How can the malware be detected?
   - What can we do without such tools?
- Home work: What ways there are to protect against the malware? What would be your way in ideal world?

(RATIONALE: A bit more technical, but interesting point how anti-malware systems work, with what kind of a logic)

### 8th lecture (live recording): Following a mentor
A designated day when we follow remotely for few hours of cyber security professional's daily work. The event is live and the cyber security expert will answer audience questions on the go. This is a virtual event, not recorded. An opportunity to understand hands-on work what cyber security professionals do to make our days more secure. Write one page essay of what have you learned.
(if you aren't able to attend, please see documentary of similar topic, and write 1 page essay about it).

(RATIONALE: Get to see the work in action. Interesting opportunity to follow someone at work. Don't know how feasible this is, but would be interesting anyways.)
