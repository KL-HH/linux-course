# x) Cyber meter
- the cyber meter is all about to measure the cybersecurity capabilities:
- - where you are and defining where to be be
  - Someone to prepare the discussion
  - someone to define the situation
  - someone to analyze the result
- Carry out the plan of development activities
- There are three levels:
- - The levels measuer capabilities of cybersecurity: none (do not meet requirements), level 1 (basic ones, ad hoc ones), level 2 (a bit more advanced and comprehensive), and level 3 ( comprehensive and advanced)
  -  The cybermeter maturity report is detailed repor intended to report and guide the development of internal work.


# a) Make-belief analysis
Next, I will imagine a situation where the cybermeter could be used. I choose discussion between cybersecurity professional (CP) who will lead the discussion, and system manager (SM) responsible for a document management system. I chose "ACCESS" topic from the cybermeter. I go through only the first section "Establish and Maintain Identities".

CP: Does the users have different identities for the system?
SM: Yes, we have several access management identities for several diffent roles
CP: So, fully implemented. Do you share the credentials for the users?
SM: Only upon request, yes.
CP: Fully implemented. Do you remove the identities once you don't need them anymore?
SM: We don't have any procedure on that. We only remove the access if we are asked to remove the identity.
CP: Sounds troubling. I will put number 1 "not implemented". Have you defined and enforced the password strength and reuse restrictions?
SM: We have only system built parameters, which follow some of the guidelines what password need to inclüde, but it's not aligned our company's policy. Generally the requirements match.
CP: I will put 3 "Mostly implemented". Do you review and update identity repositories? 
SM: No, we don't have any procedure to that. Our system does not get the information of employees identity from any other system, and thus we are not able to catch changes in the organization in our system.
CP: Thanks for sharing. I will put '1' for this. Do you remove the identities based on time periods defined by our organization?
SM: Well, we have that opportunity. We used only on some cases where we are asked to set the time thresholds.
CP: Ok, so '2', partially implemented. Are privileged credentials limited to certain processes where they are required?
SM: No, our privileged access are almost as powerful as admin account, with just few limitations. So I would say privileged access grants way more than needed or should be given.
CP: Ok, '1' in this case again. Do you require stronger credentials, multifactor authentication or single use credentials for higher risk access?
SM: We require strong credentials, much stronger than for regular access, but we don't use any other method for signing in.
CP: In that case, I will put '3' Mostly implemented. Does the system offer multifactor authentication?
SM: Not feasible for us as we use SSO (single sign-on). But we have multifactor authentication readiness in our system.
CP: Ok, I will put that as a '3' mostly implemented. Are identities somehow disabled after a certain period of time of inactivity?
SM: Well our system provides the technical capability to this, but we have not activated it.
CP: I see, '1' again this case again. 








# b) Pros and cons
Cyber meter can be really usefull in the right hands, such as cyber secrurity professionals. I think it's their responsibility to initiate the discussion of cyber securty in the company using this cyber meter. For small businesses I don't find it useful as it can be quite time consuming to go keep the document updated. But for both, big and small businesses it can provide interesting insights for cyber security. In the right hands, such as cyber security professionals, it can be definitely a strong tool to identify the streghtns and weaknesses of company's cyber security. In it's at everybodys' responsibility to make sure that proper actions are taken for proper cyber security measures.

# c) Similar tools

There are some similar tools or questionnaires with which one can assess the cyber security maturity of a company.

- One questionnaire type of tool is provided by Ford Foundation: https://www.fordfoundation.org/work/our-grants/building-institutions-and-networks/cybersecurity-assessment-tool/

- One tool is Cybersecurity Assesmsent Tool (CAT): https://cybercat.tools/

- Then of course there are companies providing the service to assess the cybersecurity level, such as Into Security: https://intosecurity.fi/
