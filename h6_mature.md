- the cyber meter is all about to measure the cybersecurity capabilities:
- - where you are and defining where to be be
  - Someone to prepare the discussion
  - someone to define the situation

- There are three levels:
- - The levels measuer capabilities of cybersecurity: none (do not meet requirements), level 1 (basic ones, ad hoc ones), level 2 (a bit more advanced and comprehensive), and level 3 ( comprehensive and advanced)

# a) Make-belief analysis


# b) Pros and cons
Cyber meter can be really usefull in the right hands, such as cyber secrurity professionals. I think it's their responsibility to initiate the discussion of cyber securty in the company using this cyber meter. For small businesses I don't find it useful as it can be quite time consuming to go keep the document updated. But for both, big and small businesses it can provide interesting insights for cyber security. In the right hands, such as cyber security professionals, it can be definitely a strong tool to identify the streghtns and weaknesses of company's cyber security. In it's at everybodys' responsibility to make sure that proper actions are taken for proper cyber security measures.
