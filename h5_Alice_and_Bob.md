### Chapter 1

- Text can be read, but if you want to hide the message, you encrypt (enchipher) it. This text you call ciphertext. On the otherhand decryption (decipher) is the process to make the ciphertext readible again. Cryptography is the art and science behind the solutions to make the message secure, unreadible, an turn it back to readible format (by those who are privileged to read it).
- In mathematical terms, the encryption function (E) operates on message (M) resulting in ciphertext (C), or **E(M)=C**. On the otherhand, the reverce process would be that decryption function (D) would operate on ciphertext (C) resulting in a message (M), or in mathematical function: **D(C)=M**.

- Cryptography is also used in authentication, integrity (message has not been modified during transit), and nonrepudiation (proof of sending a message)
- Modern cryptography uses **key** (K) to solve problem of some drawbacks of restricted algorithms. Key basically adds an extra security layer to the encryption. Even if you know the algorithm you need the key to decypher the message, because key was used also the encrypt it. Key is denoted by the K subscript in the function,n and depending on a situation can be K1, K2, and so forth:
