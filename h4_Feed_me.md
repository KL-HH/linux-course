# X) Feed reader
- Imagine a situation: rather than going to check informational content on a website by yourself, let the information rather reach you automatically. This is basically what feeds are all about.
- Feed typically containts headlines, summaries and updates, and has a link to the same article. The content is distributet in real time so you can always stay up to date of what's happening.
- The technology can also keep track what you have read or not read, and thus help you to keep track of the news.
- You may generate feeds from e.g. social media (by automatically share content of your interest), news articles, blogs, or even lunch menus.
- RSS and Atom are known feed enablers. RSS stands for "Really Simple Syndication". They are both protocols that "talks" with the websites to extract the content of your interest. There are two parts to RSS: the actual reader and the the actual feeds
- So overall the time saved in manual work can have a huge benefit. There are many apps that provide easy interface and platform for you to get started to get those feeds.

# y) Supreme court
- Conviction in case where an individual used port scanning. If he would have achieved, he could have gained access in bank's system to look like the connection would have come within.
- Companies takes these port scanning seriously, and will take action to pursue to get the person to be accountable of his/her actions. Port scanning leaves traces, and individuals trying to portscan can be caught with investigations and be trialed.
- Port scanning is illegal action even if you cannot access the system, or you can access, but you won't utilize that access to go further in the systems. Just trying such port scannings increases the security costs of companies, as the verdict says.

# a) Install a feed reader
Let's start installing a feed reader. As I'm not familiar with any feed readers, I chose "Thunderbird" as suggested. I downloaded it from https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/ by clicking and installing the Thunderbird Setup 145.0.exe

Going forward with standard setup. I use the Thunderbird without an email setup. Then I press "Alt" to open the menu bar, and click New --> Feed Account. My feed account name is "Feeds (blogs, news, other)". Let's see is it a good name :-)

I inserted my first feed by right clicking the "Feeds (blogs, news, other"), chose "Subscribe...". A menu popped out and in the URL link I pasted my ultimate favorite feed of all times "https://terokarvinen.com/index.xml". So by clicking "Add" I have actually inswerted it in my RSS feed. The "Add" button is now "Verify"... Missed the chance to take a screenshot :-)
