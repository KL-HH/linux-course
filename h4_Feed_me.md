# X) Feed reader
- Imagine a situation: rather than going to check informational content on a website by yourself, let the information rather reach you automatically. This is basically what feeds are all about.
- Feed typically containts headlines, summaries and updates, and has a link to the same article. The content is distributet in real time so you can always stay up to date of what's happening.
- The technology can also keep track what you have read or not read, and thus help you to keep track of the news.
- You may generate feeds from e.g. social media (by automatically share content of your interest), news articles, blogs, or even lunch menus.
- RSS and Atom are known feed enablers. RSS stands for "Really Simple Syndication". They are both protocols that "talks" with the websites to extract the content of your interest. There are two parts to RSS: the actual reader and the the actual feeds
- So overall the time saved in manual work can have a huge benefit. There are many apps that provide easy interface and platform for you to get started to get those feeds.

# y) Supreme court
- Conviction in case where an individual used port scanning. If he would have achieved, he could have gained access in bank's system to look like the connection would have come within.
- Companies takes these port scanning seriously, and will take action to pursue to get the person to be accountable of his/her actions. Port scanning leaves traces, and individuals trying to portscan can be caught with investigations and be trialed.
- Port scanning is illegal action even if you cannot access the system, or you can access, but you won't utilize that access to go further in the systems. Just trying such port scannings increases the security costs of companies, as the verdict says.

# a) Install a feed reader and my first feed
Let's start installing a feed reader. As I'm not familiar with any feed readers, I chose "Thunderbird" as suggested. I downloaded it from https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/ by clicking and installing the Thunderbird Setup 145.0.exe

<img width="506" height="392" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8be4ddc2-a5c8-4f30-85b5-537171120694" />

Going forward with standard setup. I use the Thunderbird without an email setup. Then I press "Alt" to open the menu bar, and click New --> Feed Account. My feed account name is "Feeds (blogs, news, other)". Let's see is it a good name :-)

<img width="565" height="433" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/819bd6e7-945c-4a67-9631-f0a587b9862d" />

I inserted my first feed by right clicking the "Feeds (blogs, news, other)", chose "Subscribe...". 

<img width="339" height="374" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bad3261-a27f-4b1d-be92-007873ad0acb" />

A menu popped out and in the URL link I pasted my ultimate favorite feed of all times "https://terokarvinen.com/index.xml". So by clicking "Add" I have actually inswerted it in my RSS feed. The "Add" button is now "Verify"... Missed the chance to take a screenshot :-)

<img width="731" height="523" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2adc4353-e782-4168-8c82-950574d3b911" />

The latest feed is about "Salt Master-Slave" published on 4th of November.

<img width="1451" height="569" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7bae8386-9dfe-4455-933b-65883b55f995" />

I would like to see only relatively recent blogs, so I will change the view to show me only feeds that are less than 30 days. Let's right click the "Feeds (blogs, news, other)" and select "Search Messages...", set the 30 days, and "Save as Search Folder". Then I justnamed it as "Month" and saved.

<img width="341" height="397" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e1cbb96-dae6-4d7d-bd8c-1c9c08954509" />

<img width="643" height="450" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7dc877eb-c79a-4b0f-8619-945c8bda157a" />

And there it is! Our filtered folder.

<img width="513" height="180" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/806dbc4d-8be3-4975-9734-0fd89e872c84" />



# b) Add a feed for Krebs

Let's add another feed. I'm goin to add "Krebs on Security" news in my feed: https://krebsonsecurity.com/. Luckily I have the link for feed: https://krebsonsecurity.com/feed/

Let's go to "Subscribe..." again

<img width="260" height="391" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b66da0c-3cac-4bd2-b40b-ebb9be16c2c3" />


A new windows pop up. Then let's add a feed by pasting the "https://krebsonsecurity.com/feed/" URL to the "Feed URL". Press "Add".

<img width="741" height="530" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f49818f-2beb-40ad-a791-8231bf8c91ba" />

And there it is:
<img width="374" height="165" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec340237-c0e0-4515-a429-42a8002ee9ab" />

Now my Month folder is flooded with news from Krebs:
<img width="1035" height="205" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b661826a-a28e-4311-8ca1-500c9c033611" />



# c) Add a feed for Schneier on Security. Find the blog, and locate the feed.
It's always good to have some other opinions or viewpoints on security, so I'll add Schneier too. You can get those news from Schneier on Security: https://www.schneier.com/

You can find RSS feed logo from the website:

<img width="431" height="482" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/626ff221-a004-4c68-b689-c4903c4b97ed" />

The picture takes me to a URL link: https://www.schneier.com/feed/atom/

<img width="400" height="100" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06987ba0-8b94-46fb-9cde-b452989cd909" />

Worth mentioning, that deleting atom takes you to another kind of feed page: https://www.schneier.com/feed/.

By following the same steps as above (Right click on "Feeds (blogs, news, other) --> Subscribe. Enter the URL in "Feed URL", and press "Add". It's in the feed!

<img width="967" height="559" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a96d017d-2399-4371-8e96-298462cf0d5a" />

Well take a look at that... Bruce Schneider just published an article today!

<img width="1332" height="191" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf32ac15-3fa8-44c4-9c30-e1306b93b826" />



# d) Find and add two more security related feeds. Explain how you found them, and why you chose them.

I chose to add couple of other feeds. 

First one is "Darknet Diaries" podcasts, which was introduced on our second assignment (h2_scene). The website is: https://darknetdiaries.com/. This site is publishing podcasts about different cyber security topic, such as hackers, breachers, cybercrime, and other. You can find at least two times the RSS feed subscription in this site. Once, when you just scroll a bit lower...

<img width="1204" height="347" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19673256-9596-4812-86ab-6ab86c20baf4" />

... and second when you scroll completely down:

<img width="1022" height="234" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d674977f-288f-4469-83fb-b962c722f2d4" />

By pressing the Subscribe button, I'm taken to another page, and scrolling that down I can find the "RSS Feed".

<img width="763" height="684" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/52b3cae5-6957-4281-a6d5-c859718a2cbd" />

By my surprise, the feed is behind the link https://podcast.darknetdiaries.com/. 

<img width="421" height="119" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8e01998b-c402-443b-818a-7f53ecd5c93f" />

I wanted to show a third option by being clever and find the feed like a pro from here https://darknetdiaries.com/feed, but it ended into a typical "Error 404":

<img width="383" height="190" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27a5fa38-3446-49c4-8ada-e380bdf01f40" />

Maybe next time...

So I added the RSS into my Feeds, as above I have made it.

Ok, the second feed now.. I was thinking of adding a feed from Mikko Hyppönen, but that turned out to be hard. I didn't find anything "feed like" from his website, nor didn't I find the way to make his twitter posts as feeds either. But then I found this "Herrasmieshakkerit". Apparently Mikko is behind these posts, so that would suit me very well!. The website is: https://hakkerit.libsyn.com/.

I can already see the RSS feed symbol in the front page:

<img width="827" height="575" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15d6072f-7e0d-467a-bd70-44f19eaba3ed" />

Scrolling down is pointless.. It just loads me more news. I wanted to be a "pro" this time again, but had to dissapoint (there is no website as "https://hakkerit.libsyn.com/feed"...)

But by pushing the RSS symbol I get in to a RSS feed like site: https://rss.libsyn.com/shows/210590/destinations/1518941.xml

Let's add that the same way as above. After all the steps mentioned above I have added total five feeds to my birdie (Thunderbird)

<img width="523" height="232" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74720766-eb55-4990-b32d-d7fa75ceaab9" />





# e) Follow security feeds for a while.
When I ended the previous d) assignment (on 14th of November) the last feeds were these ones:
<img width="1134" height="151" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad88543d-a61c-4aa0-9b0f-ae013b6fcfe3" />



# f) Port scan
Let's install the port scan for our cyber security course. I use Linux (in virtual system). This command should let us install the port scan:

<img width="666" height="82" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2215d1f7-5040-48ef-b776-3769ba10afc1" />

Good to go (I think):

<img width="547" height="182" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4a622238-dd30-4cc2-b65d-208b5c1fcd6f" />

But before I go (to jail), I need to disconnect myself from the internet. Just in case, I will disconnect myself from WiFi, and I will put the flight mode on, just in case.

<img width="331" height="261" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d71f9d6b-eae4-4671-815b-959e62cd420e" />

Let’s ping 8.8.8.8 by typing ‘ping 8.8.8.8’. I get this as an answer. I have to say, I don’t know is now showing that it’s not working, because I don’t know what would it do if it is..., but the internet is at least disconnected (plane icon on the right side)

<img width="1095" height="124" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd17a823-31c3-4262-98f7-0475fa5c32cb" />


Well... I pressed ctrl+C to quit the command, and got this

<img width="1091" height="204" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a25dcec-5ba5-4055-9262-975dc9a3d419" />

Still no idea what to expect, but at least I didn’t receive anything. That’s a good sign, I think :-)

Now let’s ping myself

<img width="1092" height="136" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e66d01cb-cfcb-40fe-bdcb-994f3e1ec2a7" />

And press ‘Enter’

<img width="1086" height="345" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/39e22c0b-d385-4c68-80bb-58ab4da94556" />

And then I realized I used the wrong command, so... Let's try again by typing 'sudo nmap -A -v localhost'. Too technical to explain what are these commands, but this is how it goes..

<img width="1330" height="709" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8bb9ba9-139b-4d1a-bf70-44273d90304e" />
<img width="1332" height="683" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9bd6287-39c8-4495-b2d1-ef6c5871abc0" />


After ending the command, I put the internet back on to install the Daemon. I think the command would be 'sudo apt update' and 'sudo apt install psad'. I looked this by googling (AI answer).

<img width="1214" height="269" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aceb34f6-61e6-4191-8b8d-c7f79386b4bb" />

This is now installed... But I don't know how to use it...

<img width="1214" height="269" alt="Sieppaa1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e7e8bd0-12b1-4cb3-8dd9-48c5f07f64ba" />


I tried the same 'sudo nmap -A -v localhost'
<img width="1335" height="731" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/616c6356-24ae-4c3b-9368-aef779774c71" />
