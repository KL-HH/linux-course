# Reviewing the arcticle of "A Review of Modern Authentication Methods in Digital Systems" 

In this assignment, I'm reviewing an article written by Midhuna Jyothi R, and Jeyanthi N. named "A Review of Modern Authentication Methods in Digital Systems" (2023). The article can be read here: https://doi.org/10.1109/AICERA/ICIS59538.2023.10420169. 

The article reviews modern authentication methods used in a digital environment concentrating on the possibilities of passwordless authentication. Authentication is a security procedure to protect information, service or other such from illegitimate access. It also ensures that valid users are correctly identified. The key message of this article is, that as conventional method of signing in, such as textual and numerical passwords (PIN codes), provides ongoing security concerns new ways of authentication is needed: thus, the trend towards passwordless authentication. 

The conventional way of signing in uses textual passwords and PIN codes. The conventional ways are considered easy to use and cost effective, but they have one critical downside: they are insecure, especially among people whose awareness are not in the level of ideal users. In those cases, passwords might be generally weak against attacks and have only one password for many applications. And this does not even include the cost on the business side including costs such as desk costs, storage, registration costs, and managing and resetting passwords. So raises the need for passwordless authentication, but what is it exactly and how does it work in general? 

So, what is passwordless authentication? In short, if authentication is not dependent on some sort of knowledge based secret information, such as passwords, it can be most of the time termed as passwordless authentication. As an example, biometrics and digital certificates are passwordless systems at their best, but can include also tokens, emails, and OAuth2.0 protocol. 

## Techniques of passwordless authentication

Passwordless authentication is by no means a bullet-proof way against cyber criminals as the article points out, but it provides a different level of security on the daily tasks. There are three related techniques worth mentioning: 1) continuous authentication, 2) adaptive authentication, and 3) PKI based authentication. 

In continuous authentication, the mechanism constantly monitors and analyzes security parameters. If any suspicious activity is detected by the mechanism, it system might be denied further access. The continuous authentication even monitors user behavior, such as mouse movements, keystrokes, touchscreen navigation behavior, and others.  

Adaptive authentication has to adapt to the ever-changing user environment, such as devices, location, and other contextual factors. It can evaluate the risk level based on different levels, such as PIN codes, IP address, geographic location, time of access, usage context, and others. 

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) uses digital certificates for authentication, such as user identity or email signing certificates. It is considered to be quick, reliable, and also scalable. 

Overall, it is seen that there is a need for such passwordless authentication scheme that would be secure in interconnected environments with different user interaction scenarios.
